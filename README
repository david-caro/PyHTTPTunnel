This is a little script that can be used as a http/https tunnel and (1.0 right 
now) it is able to change the request and the response according to some 
regexps rules, it can also add custom headers to the request and the response 
see sampple config (autogenerated by the script).

It creates a sample config file when called with the option create_config, the 
sample config might have more than one section (for now it only uses the first 
one)
