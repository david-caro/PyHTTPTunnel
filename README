This is a little script that can be used as a http/https tunnel and (1.0 right 
now) might be able to change the request and the response according to some 
rules, see sampple config (autogenerated by the script).

It creates a sample config file when called with the option create_config, the 
sample config might have more than one section (for now it only uses the first 
one)
